*A practical series for backend developers building secure full-stack apps*

If you’re strong on the backend but want to level up your frontend skills—or
just want a reusable, production-grade auth stack—this series is for you.

We’re building a modern, full-stack authentication boilerplate using:

* *Angular 19* for the frontend, featuring Signals, `@if`/`@for` control
flow, and streamlined component architecture.
* *NestJS* for the backend, powered by *PostgreSQL*, *TypeORM*, and
*JWT-based authentication*.
* A clean, modular codebase you can clone, adapt, and ship.

== 🛠️ Why This Series?

This isn’t just another tutorial.
It’s a hands-on guide for backend-focused developers who want to:

* Understand Angular without drowning in frontend complexity.
* Build secure authentication flows from scratch.
* Learn by doing—no fluff, no filler.

== 🗺️ What’s in the Series?

Here’s the roadmap 👇

You’ll go from initial setup to a fully functional, deployable stack with:

* ✅ JWT login and registration
* ✅ Protected routes and role-based access
* ✅ Angular 19 Signals and new control flow syntax
* ✅ Full PostgreSQL integration with TypeORM
* ✅ CI/CD pipeline, E2E testing with Playwright, and Docker deployment

Each part builds on the last.
No prior Angular or NestJS experience required—just TypeScript and backend
fundamentals.
